The PPM version of the test images was downloaded from the link: http://www1.hft-leipzig.de/strutz/Papers/SCFenhanced-resources/

The RGB version of the test images was created by extracting raw RGB data from the PPM version and saving them in bitdepth of 8. 

The YUV version of the test images was made by converting the RGB data to ITU-R Rec. BT. 709 YCbCr 8-bit format through the following calculations:

t = 0.2126*R + 0.7152*G + 0.0722*B;
Y = floor(16 + 219 * t / 255 + 0.5);
Cb = floor(128 + 112 * (B - t) / (255 * (1 - 0.0722)) + 0.5);
Cr = floor(128 + 112 * (R - t) / (255 * (1 - 0.2126)) + 0.5);

where t is a floating-point variable; R, G, B, Y, Cb, and Cr are integers, floor(x) is the largest integer of x, and single-precision floating-point processing was used in all calculations.
